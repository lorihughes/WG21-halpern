X Make sure issue is filed to remove allocators from `function`. Present paper
  for resolution?
* Paper to change `function` in LFTS to use `polymorphic_allocator` instead of
  type-erasure for allocators, including in `function`.
* Update to P0075 for_loop
* Update to P0076 vec policy
* Update to P0209 make_from_tuple
* Propose alternative names for `seq`, `unseq`, and `par_vec` for SG1/LEWG/LWG.

   Move P0075 to LEWG

   Remove ordered scatters from P0076, move to LEWG, EWG/Core

   P0209 Remove uninitialized_construct_from_tuple, Add an example, move to LWG

   Changes to P0208:
      * Move `copy_assign` into main part of proposal.  Consider renaming to
       `copy_swap`.
      * Alternative for `copy_swap_helper`: `copy_swap_transaction` that makes
        a copy and calls a lambda.
      * Add use in `std::experimental::function`
      * Add example in wording
