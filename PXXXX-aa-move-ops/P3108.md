Abstract
========

An standard allocator-aware type `T` typically provides a move constructor,
`T(T&&)` and an *extended* move constructor `T(T&&, const
allocator_type&)`. The extended move constructor behaves like the regular move
constructor if allocator being passed as the second argument is the same as the
allocator for the object being moved; otherwise, the contents of the first
argument cannot be "pilfered" and a copy must be made. Similarly, when
move-assigning an allocator-aware object, a copy must be made, depending on the
allocator propagation traits, when the allocators of the assigned-from and
assigned-to objects don't match. A pair of function templates,
`move_construct_with_allocator` and `move_assign_with_allocator`, that codify
these allocator-aware move patterns to allow for simpler Standard-library
wording and easier implementation of standard, third-party, and private
allocator-aware C++ libraries.
