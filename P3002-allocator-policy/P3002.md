Abstract
========

To ensure consistency and cut down on excessive debate, LEWG is in the process
of creating a standing document of design policies to be followed by default
when proposing new facilities for the Standard Library; exceptions to these
policies would require the paper authors to provide rationale for exception.
Because the Standard Library should give users control over the source of
memory used by Library objects, policies on when and how classes should accept
an allocator is badly needed so that it does not become an afterthought.  This
paper proposes three policies related to allocator use, each with guiding
principles and each citing examples in the current Standard.  The policies
proposed herein can be developed and adopted separately or as a group.

Policy 1: When should a class use an allocator?
===============================================

1. A class that allocates memory should accept an allocator at construction and
   retain a copy of that allocator for allocation and deallocation.

2. A class that contains subobjects (base classes or members) that use
   allocators should accept an allocator at construction to forward to those
   subobjects.

Principles
----------

1. **The Standard Library should be general and flexible**. To the extent
   possible, he user of a library class should have control over how memory is
   allocated.

2. **The Standard Library should be consistent**. The use of allocators should
   be consistent with the existing allocator-aware classes and class templates,
   especially those in the containers library.

3. **The Standard Library should encapsulate complexity**.  Fully general
   application of allocators is potentially complex and is best left to the
   experts implementing the Standard Library.  Users can choose their own
   subset of desirable allocator behavior only if the underlying Library
   Classes allow them to choose their preferred approach, whether it be
   stateless allocators, template allocators, polymorphic allocators, or no
   allocators.

Examples in the current Standard
--------------------------------

The following examples both illustrate the policy and provide models how
allocator-aware interfaces and behaviors are rendered in the Standard.

o **Classes that allocate memory from an allocator**: `vector<T, A>`,
  `set<K, A>`, etc.

o **Classes that forward an allocator to subobjects**: `tuple<T...>`


Policy 2: When should a type have an alias in the `std::pmr` namespace?
=======================================================================

o A class template `T` having an allocator parameter `A` defaulted to a
  specialization of `std::allocator` should have an alias, `pmr::T` where `A`
  is a specialization of `pmr::polymorphic_allocator`.

o An alias `S` for such a class template that sets `A` to a specialization of
  `std::allocator` should have an alias `pmr::S` where `A` is set to a
  specialization of `pmr::polymorphic_allocator`.

Principles
----------

**The Standard Library should provide simplifications of complex
facilities**. The PMR part of the standard library is intended to provide a
simplified allocator model for a common use case -- that of providing an
allocator to a class object and its subparts without infecting the object's
type. Staying within the `pmr` namespace simplifies user code, as it is much
easier to write and understand `std::pmr::vector<std::pmr::new_type<T>>` than
`std::pmr::vector<std::new_type<T, std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<T>>>`.

**The Standard Library should be consistent**. Existing allocator-aware types
follow this policy, so a user would expect new ones to follow it, too.

Examples in the current Standard
--------------------------------

**Classes with default allocators**: `vector`, `unordered_set`, `basic_string`,
and all of the other allocator-aware containers have a `pmr` alias.

**Aliases that use the default allocator**: `string`, `string32`, and the other
aliases for `basic_string` have `pmt` aliases.
