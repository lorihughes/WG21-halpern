Abstract
========

> The most convenient way to look up an element of a `map` or `unordered_map`
> is to use the index operator, i.e., `theMap[key]`. This operator has a number
> of limitations, however: 1) it does not work for `const` containers, 2) it
> does not work if the mapped type is not default-constructible, 3) it modifies
> the container if the key is not found, 4) it can be inefficient for mapped
> types having expensive default constructors or expensive assignment
> operators, 5) a default-constructed value is not always the desired value
> when the key is not found. These limitations often require that the user
> resort to using the `find` member function, which returns an iterator and
> typically leads to more complex code having at least one `if` statement
> and/or duplicate lookup operations. This paper take inspiration from other
> languages, especially Python, and proposes three simple member functions
> (`get`, `get_ref`, and `replace`) that simplify lookups for `map` and
> `unordered_map` in situations where the index operator is suboptimal.
