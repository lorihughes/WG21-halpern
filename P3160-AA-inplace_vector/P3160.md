Abstract
========

The `inplace_vector` proposal, [@P0843R10] is moving forward without allocator
support. This paper proposes that `inplace_vector` *should* have allocator
support ane explores the pro and con of adding such support direction into
`inplace_vector` vs. a separate `basic_inplace_vetor` class template. This
proposal is separate from [@P0843R10] so that the latter can move forward more
quickly, while allocator-specific policies are still being worked out.

Motivation
==========

General Motivation for allocator-aware types
--------------------------------------------

*Note: The text below is borrowed nearly verbetim from [@P3002R1], which
proposes a general policy for when types should use allocators*

Memory management is a major part of building software. Numerous facilities in
the C++ Standard library exist to give the programmer maximum control over how
their program uses memory:

* `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` are parameterized with *deleter*
  objects that control, among other things, how memory resources are reclaimed.

* `std::vector` is preferred over other containers in many cases because its
  use of contiguous memory provides optimal cache locality and minimizes
  allocate/deallocate operations. Indeed, the LEWG has spent a lot of time on
  `flat_set` ([@P1222R0]) and `flat_map`
  ([@P0429R3]), whose underlying structure defaults to
  `vector` for this reason.

* Operators `new` and `delete` are replaceable, giving programmers global
  control over how memory is allocated.

* The C++ object model makes a clear distinction between an object's memory
  footprint and it's lifetime.

* Language constructs such as `void*` and `reinterpet_cast` provide
  fine-grained access to objects' underlying memory.

* Standard containers and strings are parameterized with allocators, providing
  object-level control over memory allocation and element construction.

This fine-grained control over memory that C++ gives the programmer is a large
part of why C++ is applicable to so many domains --- from embedded systems with
limited memory budgets to games, high-frequency trading, and scientific
simulations that require cache locality, thread affinity, and other
memory-related performance optimizations.

An in-depth description of the value proposition for allocator-aware software
can be found in [@P2035R0].  Standard containers are
the most ubiquitous examples of *allocator-aware* types. Their `allocator_type`
and `get_allocator` members and allocator-parameterized constructors allow them
to be used like LegoÂ® parts that can be combined and nested as necessary while
retaining full programmer control over how the whole assembly allocates
memory. For *scoped allocators* --- those that apply not only to the top-level
container, but also to its elements --- having each element of a container
support a predictable allocator-aware interface is crucial to giving the
programmer the ability to allocate all memory from a single memory resource,
such as an arena or pool. Note that the allocator is a *configuration*
parameter of an object and does not contribute to its value.

In short, the principles underlying this policy proposal are:

1. **The Standard Library should be general and flexible**. To the extent
   possible, the user of a library class should have control over how memory is
   allocated.

2. **The Standard Library should be consistent**. The use of allocators should
   be consistent with the existing allocator-aware classes and class templates,
   especially those in the containers library.

3. **The parts of the Standard Library should work together**. If one part of
   the library gives the user control over memory allocation but another part
   does not, then the second part undermines the utility of the first.

4. **The Standard Library should encapsulate complexity**.  Fully general
   application of allocators is potentially complex and is best left to the
   experts implementing the Standard Library.  Users can choose their own
   subset of desirable allocator behavior only if the underlying Library
   classes allow them to choose their preferred approach, whether it be
   stateless allocators, statically typed allocators, polymorphic allocators,
   or no allocators.

Motivation for an Allocator-aware `inplace_vector`
--------------------------------------------------

Although the objects stored in an `std::inplace_vector`, as proposed in
[@P0843R10] can be initialized with any set of valid constructor arguments,
including allocator arguments, the fact that the `inplace_vector` itself is not
allocator-aware prevents it from working consistently with other parts of the
standard library, specifically those parts that depend on *uses-allocator
construction* (section [allocator.uses.construction]) in the standard). For
example:

```
pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource rsrc;
pmr::polymorphic_allocator<> alloc{ &rsrc };
using V = inplace_vector<pmr::string, 10>;
V v = make_obj_using_allocator<V>(alloc, { "hello", "goodbye" });
assert(v[0].get_allocator() == alloc);  // FAILS
```

Even though an allocator is supplied, it is not used to construct the
`pmr::string` objects within the resulting `inplace_vector` object because `inplace_vector` does
not have the necessary hooks for `make_obj_using_allocator` to recognize it as
being allocator-aware.  Note that, although this example and the ones that
follow use `pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, the same issues would apply to any
scoped allocator.

*Uses-allocator construction* is rarely used directly in user code.  Instead,
it is used within the implementation of standard containers and scoped
allocators to ensure that the allocator used to construct the container is also
used to construct its elements.  Continuing the example above, consider what
happens if an `inplace_vector` is stored in a `pmr::vector`, compared to
storing a truly allocator-aware type (`pmr::string`):

```
pmr::vector<pmr::string> vs(alloc);
pmr::vector<V>           vo(alloc);

vs.emplace_back("hello");
vo.emplace_back({ "hello" });

assert(vs.back().get_allocator() == alloc);      // OK
assert(vo.back()[0]->get_allocator() == alloc);  // FAILS
```

An important invariant when using a scoped allocator such as
`pmr::polymorphic_allocator` is that the same allocator is used throughout an
object hierarchy. It is impossible to ensure that this invariant is preserved
when using `std::inplace_vector`, even if each element is originally inserted
with the correct allocator, because `inplace_vector` does not remember the
allocator used to construct it and cannot therefore supply the allocator to new
elements.

Design options
==============

There are several possible designs for an allocator-aware `inplace_vector`:

`inplace_vector<class T, size_t N, class Alloc = std::allocator<T>>`
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The allocator would be stored in the object and returned by get_allocator(). If
`uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc>` is true, then elements are constructed via
*uses-allocator construction* with the supplied allocator. For
`std::allocator`, no space would be need to be taken up -- in fact, that should
be a requirement, so that `sizeof(inplace_vector<T, N>)` is guaranteed to be
*N* * `sizeof(T)`, i.e., no size overhead for the default allocator case.

**Pros**: Simplest design, most consistent with other containers, zero runtime
overhead for the default case.

**Cons**: If `uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc>` is false and `Alloc` is a non-empty
class, then space is wasted storing an unused allocator.  Alternative a) We
could create a special case that a default-constructed Alloc could be returned
from `get_allocator()`, if `Alloc` is default-constructible.  Alternative b) In
this case, inplace_vector could be non-allocator-aware, `allocator_type` and
`get_allocator()` would not be defined and no constructors would accept an
allocator argument.  Alternative c) Supplying an allocator other than
`std::allocator` to for a type that cannot use it could be ill-formed;
unfortunately, this would make generic programming somewhat more difficult.

`inplace_vector<class T, size_t N>`
--------------------------------------

If `T::allocator_type` exists, then `inplace_vector<class T, size_t
N>::allocator_type` would also exist, as would `get_allocator()` and
allocator-accepting constructors.  Otherwise, the instantiation would not be
allocator aware.

**Pros**: Easiest for users -- no need to consider whether to supply an allocator template argument.

**Cons**: If `T` is allocator-aware but the user doesn't want to take advantage
of that, an allocator is stored unnecessarily.  Worse, there are no obvious
work-arounds to avoid storing and using an allocator. Also, this approach is
inconsistent with other containers.

`inplace_vector<class T, size_t N, class Alloc =` *see below* `>`
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The *see below* type is `T::allocator_type` if such a type exists, and
`std::allocator<byte>` otherwise.  This approach combines the advantages of the
previous 2.  Unlike approach 2, however, the user can explicitly specify an
allocator (presumably `std::allocator`) other than `T::allocator_type`, if they
don't want to take up space in the vector for an allocator that will just be
defaulted anyway.

`basic_inplace_vector<class T, size_t N, class Alloc>`
---------------------------------------------------------

This approach has a separate template, `basic_inplace_vector`, for
allocator-aware inplace vector.

**Pros**: Reduces complications with `inplace_vector` specification and
implementation.  Potentially reduces compile time compared to some of the
preceding options.

**Cons**: The two types of inplace vector are not compatible.  The user needs
to make a decision, especially in generic code, whether they ever expect to
have allocator-aware elements. It is easy to choose the shorter name at the
expense of breaking scoped allocation in generic code.

Compile time data
=================

Compile time experiments with a subset of an `inplace_vector` implementation
compare the status quo to option 3.1, described above.  The results below show
that there is no appreciable penalty for non-allocator-aware element types
(e.g., `inplace_vector<int, N>`) but a noticeable impact for allocator-aware
elements (e.g., `inplace_vector<string, N>`). Further experimentation is needed
to see if compile-times can be reduced. The experiments can be found at
[https://github.com/phalpern/WG21-halpern/tree/main/P3160-AA-inplace_vector/](P3160-AA-inplace_vector/)

| test name | compiler | status quo | option 3.1 | increase |
| --------- | -------- | ---------: | ---------: | -------: |
| Non-AA T | g++ | 3.99 | 3.94 | -1% |
| AA T | g++ | 4.39 | 5.92 | 35% |
| Blended | g++ | 6.47 | 8.14 | 26% |
| Non-AA T | clang++ | 4.39 | 4.38 | 0% |
| AA T | clang++ | 4.99 | 7.2 | 44% |
| Blended | clang++ | 7.51 | 9.93 | 32% |

Conclusion
==========

The standard should remain consistent with respect to allocator-aware
containers. There are several approaches possible for making `inplace_vector`
conform and work with scoped allocators. WG21 should adopt one of them, ideally
in the same standard as `inplace_vector`.


Wording
=======

No wording yet. It depends on the direction that LEWG chooses to take.
