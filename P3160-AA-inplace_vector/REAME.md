Proof-of-concept implementation of P2667R0++ (= P2667R1?)
=========================================================

This directory contains a proof-of-concept implementation of a
small-buffer-optimization `vector` (`sbo_vector`) and fixed-capacity `vector`
(`static_vector`) as described in a not-yet-published version of P2667.

* `sbo_and_static_vector.h` -- Interface and implementation
* `sbo_and_static_vector.t.cpp` -- Incomplete test driver
