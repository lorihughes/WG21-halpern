Abstract
========

> The `noexcept` function specifier and companion `noexcept` operator were
invented to allow containers such as `vector` to provide the strong
exception-safety guarantee when performing operations that require relocating
existing elements. The `noexcept` specifier has since been regularly utilized
to improve code generation and sometimes as a form of documentation.  The
problems with these off-label uses have been known for a long time; the *Lakos
Rule*, which predated the release of C++11, was intended to prevent such use
(or misuse) within the C++ Standard Library.  This paper proposes an attribute,
`[[throws_nothing]]`, to be used instead of `noexcept` for annotating
nonthrowing functions in circumstances where the latter is ill-advised ---
specifically, when the
function in question has a *narrow contract*.  Although not part of the simple
and minimal proposal presented, this paper also explores how this
new feature could eventually be integrated with a future Contracts
facility.

Brief Summary
=============

The proposed `[[throws_nothing]]` attribute indicates that a function does not
throw when called properly, i.e., *in contract*:

```C++
[[throws_nothing]] void f(int);
static_assert(noexcept(f(0)) == false);
```

Importantly, this proposed `[[throws_nothing]]` attribute, unlike the
`noexcept` specifier, is intentionally invisible to the `noexcept` operator; it
does not affect *essential behavior* and may be ignored by some platforms,
depending on the build mode. `[[throws_nothing]]` can, therefore, be added to
or removed from a function declaration without affecting program logic.

An expanded description of this proposal is in the
[Proposed Feature](#proposed-feature) section.

Motivation
==========

Purpose of `noexcept`
---------------------

The `noexcept` specifier was introduced at the end of the C++11 cycle for one
purpose: to enable the safe use of move constructors in `vector`-like
containers that offer the *strong exception-safety guarantee* for certain
operations, such as inserting elements at the end.  In
[N2855](http://wg21.link/n2855), the problem was first described and `noexcept`
was first proposed. The proposed `noexcept` wording was later refined,
eventually resulting in the final wording in [N3050](http://wg21.link/n3050).

Below is one possible implementation of a vector-reallocation function, which
must leave the original vector unchanged if an exception is thrown
while trying to move elements from the old buffer to the new one. This
implementation uses `if` `constexpr` instead of the `std::move_if_noexcept`
function to make the two different code paths easier to distinguish.

```C++
template <class T, class A>
void vector<T,A>::reallocate(size_type new_capacity)
{
  using alloc_traits = allocator_traits<A>;

  pointer new_data = alloc_traits::allocate(new_capacity);

  size_type i = 0;
  if constexpr (noexcept(T(std::move(m_data[i])))) {
    for (i = 0; i < size(); ++i)
      alloc_traits::construct(&new_data[i], std::move(m_data[i])); // efficient
  }
  else try {
    for (i = 0; i < size(); ++i)
      alloc_traits::construct(&new_data[i], m_data[i]);  // copy (less efficient)
  }
  catch (...) {
    while (i)
      alloc_traits::destroy(new_data[--i]);
    alloc_traits::deallocate(new_data, new_capacity);
    throw;
  }

  // got here only if no exception was thrown
  for (i = 0; i < size(); ++i)
    alloc_traits::destroy(m_data[i]);
  alloc_traits::deallocate(m_data, m_capacity);

  m_data     = new_data;
  m_capacity = new_capacity;
}
```

The use of `T`'s move constructor often yields algorithmic performance
advantages over using its copy constructor, sometimes reducing the cost from
*O(N)* or worse per copy to *O(1)*. The move constructor, however, often
modifies the original object; if the move constructor might throw, `vector`
must degenerate to using the copy constructor, giving up the performance gain
to ensure that it can leave the original object in its initial state.  Because
`vector<T, A>::reallocate` is a *generic* function, using `std::move` and
retaining the strong guarantee in the code above would be impossible if we did
not have the `noexcept` operator.

The Lakos Rule
--------------

Since the `noexcept` annotation was added late in the C++11 cycle and was thus
brand new and not fully
understood, applying it appropriately in the Standard Library was a
challenge. John Lakos and Alisdair Meredith proposed what has become known as
the *Lakos Rule* (described in [N3279](http://wg21.link/N3279) and extended in
[P0884](http://wg21.link/P0884)).  Summarized below, the Lakos Rule provided a
safe framework for deciding whether a specific function should be declared
`noexcept`.

 * If a function has no preconditions (a *wide contract*) and is guaranteed not
   to throw, then declare it `noexcept`.
 * If a function has preconditions (a *narrow contract*) or it might
   throw when called correctly (*in contract*), then do not declare it
   `noexcept` (or declare it `noexcept(false)`).

The example below shows a subset of the `std::vector` interface. Note
that only `size()`, which promises not to throw and has no preconditions, is
declared `noexcept`, whereas `at` and `operator[]` each fail one of the tests
and are thus not `noexcept`.

```C++
template <class T, class A>
class vector {
   // ...
   constexpr size_type size() const noexcept; // wide contract,   doesn't throw
   constexpr reference at(size_type);         // wide contract,   might throw
   constexpr reference operator[](size_type); // narrow contract, doesn't throw
};
```

Resistance to the Lakos Rule
----------------------------

Although the Lakos Rule is effective and has strong theoretical and practical
underpinnings (see [P2861](http://wg21.link/P2861)), two reasons have emerged
for violating it in the Standard Library design.

 1. Under many (but by no means all) circumstances, calling a `noexcept`
    function
    generates less code.  Thus, programmers --- both within and outside WG21
    --- want to use `noexcept` to improve code generation, yet
    The author has seen no compelling evidence that `noexcept` produces
    measurably *faster* code with any modern compilers.

 2. Within WG21, that the distinction between
    "*Throws*: nothing" and `noexcept` is unclear has been discussed (see
    [P1656](http://wg21.link/P1656)).

As tempting as it might be, violating the Lakos rule is ill advised unless a
compelling case can be made that querying the function with the `noexcept`
operator is necessary for optimizing or ensuring correctness of an algorithm
at compile time. As described in [P2861](http://wg21.link/P2861), if `noexcept`
is added to a
function in one version of the Standard, it cannot be removed in a future
version without potentially breaking code.  Specifically,
widening the contract of a function to add new functionality is safe,
provided that every program written for the old version has the same
observable behavior when compiled with the new version, but if the
old version is annotated with `noexcept`, the new version cannot be
widened to accept new values that would result in an exception being thrown.

Moreover, a defensive programming library or language contract facility might
want to throw an exception on a contract violation, especially when testing the
contract checks themselves.  The `noexcept` specifier interferes with such a
facility (see [P2831](http://wg21.link/P2831)).


Proposed Feature
================

What is needed is a way to provide the desired code-generation and
documentation benefits of `noexcept` described in the
[Resistance to the Lakos Rule](#resistance-to-the-lakos-rule) section without
violating either the spirit or the letter of the Lakos Rule. The goal is to
address the constituencies within the C++ multiverse that have been
ill served by `noexcept` alone, such as embedded developers who want smaller
code and unit-testers who want to throw on contract violations.

The proposed Standard attribute, tentatively named `[[throws_nothing]]`,
indicates that a function promises not to throw when called in contract. If the
function exits via a thrown exception, the behavior is *implementation
defined*.  Critical to the `[[throws_nothing]]` feature is that its use cannot
be detected by the program itself at compile time; the result of the `noexcept`
operator is unchanged by this attribute. The `[[throws_nothing]]` attribute
does not change the type of the function, and it cannot be used to select an
algorithm at compile time.

`[[throws_nothing]]` does not change the behavior of a correct program and can
be removed in future versions of a function, provided the behavior of the
function does not change for any previously valid inputs.  By making the
behavior of an incorrect program --- one that attempts to throw from a
`[[throws_nothing]]` function --- implementation defined, rather than
specifying an action such as `std::terminate()` or letting the behavior be
undefined, we allow the behavior to vary based on optimization level or other
compiler settings (*build modes*).

A call to a function annotated with `[[throws_nothing]]` is likely to result in
smaller generated code compared to one with no annotation at
all. Additionally, the implementation has latitude to generate *safer* code by
detecting an attempt to exit such a function via an exception and taking a
fail-safe action such as terminating or invoking some user-defined violation
handler (see the
[Future Integration with Contracts](#future-integration-with-contracts)
section below). The always-terminate behavior of `noexcept` is known to be
safer than undefined behavior but might still be unsafe in a critical system
that must not
terminate. The `[[throws_nothing]]` specification allows implementations to
provide better choices for various use cases. In a debugging environment, an
implementation can provide stack dumps or trigger the debugger as soon as it
detects that an exception might escape a `[[throws_nothing]]` boundary.

As with `noexcept`, implementations of the Standard Library would be permitted
to use `[[throws_nothing]]` for any nonthrowing function, even if the Standard
itself does not mandate its use. In fact, for discretionary use by
implementations, `[[throws_nothing]]` is much better than the `noexcept`
specifier because `[[throws_nothing]]` cannot inadvertently change the meaning
of a program and is
responsive to the settings used to build the program.

Feature comparison
------------------

For functions that promise not to throw, the table below compares
`[[throws_nothing]]` to `noexcept` and to using no annotation at
all (*unmarked*). *Mode dependent* is a shorthand for *implementation defined*, where
implementations are expected to provide several build modes (see the
[Build modes](#build-modes) section below). The purpose of the
table is not to show that one annotation is better than the other, but that,
despite some overlap, they serve different purposes and therefore support
different use cases, none of which violate the Lakos Rule.

| Supports compile-time algorithm selection | no      | yes        | no                   |

Build modes
-----------

Build modes are not part of the C++ Standard, but their existence can be
implied. Initially, implementations would be expected (and encouraged) to
provide at least two build modes affecting the behavior of attempting to exit
a `[[throws_nothing]]` function via an exception.

1. **Terminate**: Call `std::terminate`, just like `noexcept` does.

2. **Ignore or rethrow**: Allow the exception to escape, as though the
   annotation were not present.

Implementations might provide other options, some of which are described in the
[Future Integration with Contracts](#future-integration-with-contracts)
section below.

Mixing build modes can be dangerous; a caller that is built in *terminate* mode
might exhibit undefined behavior when calling a `[[throws_nothing]]` function
in a different translation unit that was built in *ignore* mode. An
implementation could use name mangling to ensure that such a mixed-mode program
would not link. Alternatively, the implementation could always generate, in
addition to any other version, a "safe" version that terminates and again use
name mangling to ensure that the correct version is invoked by the caller. The
Standard, not recognizing build modes, would be silent about how they might be
implemented.

Syntax and spelling
-------------------

The `[[throws_nothing]]` annotation fits well with the conventional notion of
an attribute: Removing the attribute has no essential effect on a correct
program (see [P2552](http://wg21.link/P2552)). Rendering this functionality as
a keyword or contextual keyword seems unnecessary.

Though putting the `[[throws_nothing]]` attribute in the same location as
`noexcept` would seem logical, for an attribute to appertain to a function, the
attribute must occur either before the function declaration or immediately
after the function identifier:

```C++
[[throws_nothing]] void f(int);   // OK
void g [[throws_nothing]] (int);  // OK
void h(int) [[throws_nothing]];   // not proper attribute placement
```

The original spelling for the attribute was `[[does_not_throw]]`, which happens
to have the same number of characters as `[[throws_nothing]]`. The name was
changed to `[[throws_nothing]]` to match the "*Throws*: nothing" phrasing that
LWG uses when documenting functions that do not throw.

This paper does not propose the ability to make `[[throws_nothing]]`
conditional on a compile-time constant Boolean property, like the `noexcept`
clause is. Such functionality seems counterintuitive; this proposal
deliberately omits any method for querying the `[[throws_nothing]]` attribute,
thus the common idiom of
wrapping a function and propagating its `noexcept` property has no equivalent
for the `[[throws_nothing]]` attribute.  Nevertheless, if conditional
functionality is found to be useful (now or in the future), the syntax can be
extended with a parameter, i.e.,
`[[throws_nothing(` *constant-bool-expression* `)]]`.

Alternatives Considered
=======================

Switching `noexcept` on and off with a constant expression
----------------------------------------------------------

One use of `[[does_not_throw]]` is to allow defensive checks to throw an
exception through an otherwise-nonthrowing interface. One proposed way to
achieve
this behavior in certain build modes is to use `noexcept` in such a way that it
can be turned off for certain functions.  This approach can be implemented with
help of the preprocessor:

```C++
#ifdef CHECKED_MODE
inline constexpr bool does_not_throw = false;
#define ASSERT(cond) if (! (cond)) throw std::logic_error(#cond)
#else
inline constexpr bool does_not_throw = true;
#define ASSERT(cond) (void) 0
#endif

void f(int i) noexcept(does_not_throw)  // BAD IDEA!
{
  ASSERT(i < 0);
  // ...
}
```

With this approach, the expression `noexcept(f(0))` will yield different
results in different build modes, possibly resulting in different logic paths
for debug and release builds, and thus violate the principle that essential
behavior must not be changed by build modes --- a principle convincingly
advocated for in [P2834R0](http://wg21.link/P2834R0) and named *Build-Mode
Independence*.

Future Integration with Contracts
=================================

The proposed Contracts facility (see
[P2900](http:://wg21.link/P2900)) and the `[[throws_nothing]]` facility
overlap in a number of ways, and suggestions have emerged whereby these
features can be harmonized,
resulting in a more powerful and consistent Standard.

* `[[throws_nothing]]` can be considered a special type of contract check ---
  similar to the Contracts proposal's `pre` and `post` annotations --- but
  evaluated at a distinct time, i.e., when an exception tries to escape. The
  proposed Contracts facility gives the programmer control, via a
  user-replaceable violation handler, over how detected logic errors are
  managed, e.g., logging and terminating, logging and somehow continuing, and
  so on.  Affording the user the same level of control
  over how an escaping exception is handled by a `[[throws_nothing]]`
  function would be a powerful feature. Thus, in addition to propagate mode and
  terminate mode, an integrated facility
  might also have a convert-to-contract-violation mode.

* Integration between `[[throws_nothing]]` and contract annotations would be
  more seamless if their syntaxes were harmonized. If the Contracts facility
  ends up using a nonattribute syntax, then `[[throws_nothing]]` might be
  changed to a similar nonattribute syntax (assuming the two features first
  ship in the same Standard). As described earlier, `[[throws_nothing]]`
  cannot, in today's C++, appear at the end of a function declaration (the
  author's preferred position) and still appertain to the function.
  Pre- and post-condition annotations will almost certainly go after the
  function declaration, however, so `[[throws_nothing]]` could conceivably go
  along for the ride.

* In a build mode in which contract-checks are enabled and a throwing
  contract-violation handler is installed, the programmer would want
  contract-violation exceptions to be allowed to escape a `[[throws_nothing]]`
  function
  rather than terminating. If we integrate `[[throws_nothing]]` with Contracts,
  the compiler could automatically determine that we are using a
  contract-checking build mode and allow exceptions to escape a
  `[[throws_nothing]]` function.

* If contract annotations are given additional controls, many of those controls
  might also apply to `[[throws_nothing]]`:

```C++
     void f(int) [[ throws_nothing ]];          // Obey global build mode.
     void g(int) [[ throws_nothing audit ]];    // observed only in audit build mode
     void h(int) [[ throws_nothing enforce ]];  // always enforced
     void j(int) [[ throws_nothing assume ]];   // Assume nonthrowing; don't check.
```

> The final line above (function `j`) would generate the smallest code because
neither the caller nor callee would need to generate any exception-handling
code. This line is also the least safe because, just as in the case of other
contract
annotations, assuming something that turns out to be false would result in
(language) undefined behavior.

Effects on the Standard Library
===============================

No changes would be needed immediately in the Standard Library if
`[[throws_nothing]]` were adopted. LWG can discuss whether to replace or
augment "*Throws*: nothing" in the description with `[[throws_nothing]]` in the
interface of functions having narrow contracts that promise not to throw when
called in contract.

An immediate change might be necessary if any narrow-contract functions
targeted for C++26 are currently annotated with `noexcept`; perhaps those
annotations should be changed to `[[throws_nothing]]` or perhaps the Standard
should omit the annotation and leave it up to the implementation to decide
whether to use `[[throws_nothing]]`.  Violations of the Lakos Rule already in
C++23 could be handled on a case-by-case basis (via DRs). Minimizing such
violations would result in greater stability across implementations and
versions of the Standard.


Implementation Experience
=========================

At present, no compilers implement this feature. If this paper receives a
favorable response in EWGI, we will implement the proposed facility before
presenting
it to EWG. Implementation is expected to be a fairly simple delta on the
existing implementation of `noexcept`.


Formal Wording
==============

Wording will be provided after EWGI shows initial interest, i.e., after a
positive result in an encourages-more-work poll.
