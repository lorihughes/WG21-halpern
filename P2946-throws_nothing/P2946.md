Abstract
========

> The `noexcept` function specifier and companion `noexcept` operator were
invented to allow containers such as `vector` to provide the strong
exception-safety guarantee when performing operations that require relocating
existing elements. The `noexcept` specifier has since been regularly utilized
to improve code generation and sometimes as a form of documentation.  The
problems with these off-label uses have been known for a long time; the *Lakos
Rule*, which predated the release of C++11, was intended to prevent such use
(or misuse) within the C++ Standard Library.  This paper proposes an attribute,
`[[throws_nothing]]`, to be used instead of `noexcept` for annotating
nonthrowing functions in circumstances where the latter is ill-advised ---
specifically, when the function in question has a *narrow contract*.  The
`[[throws_nothing]]` attribute is invisible to the `noexcept` operator (i.e.,
an annotated function is considered to potentially throw) and the behavior of
an exception thrown from a `[[throws_nothing]]` function is implementation
defined, within certain constraints and recommended practices.

Motivation
==========

Purpose of `noexcept`
---------------------

The `noexcept` specifier was introduced at the end of the C++11 cycle for one
purpose: to enable the safe use of move constructors in `vector`-like
containers that offer the *strong exception-safety guarantee* for certain
operations, such as inserting elements at the end.  In
[N2855](http://wg21.link/n2855), the problem was first described and `noexcept`
was first proposed. The proposed `noexcept` wording was later refined,
eventually resulting in the final wording in [N3050](http://wg21.link/n3050).

Below is one possible implementation of a vector-reallocation function, which
must leave the original vector unchanged if an exception is thrown
while trying to move elements from the old buffer to the new one. This
implementation uses `if` `constexpr` instead of the `std::move_if_noexcept`
function to make the two different code paths easier to distinguish.

```C++
template <class T, class A>
void vector<T,A>::reallocate(size_type new_capacity)
{
  using alloc_traits = allocator_traits<A>;

  pointer new_data = alloc_traits::allocate(new_capacity);

  size_type i = 0;
  if constexpr (noexcept(T(std::move(m_data[i])))) {
    for (i = 0; i < size(); ++i)
      alloc_traits::construct(&new_data[i], std::move(m_data[i])); // efficient
  }
  else try {
    for (i = 0; i < size(); ++i)
      alloc_traits::construct(&new_data[i], m_data[i]);  // copy (less efficient)
  }
  catch (...) {
    while (i)
      alloc_traits::destroy(new_data[--i]);
    alloc_traits::deallocate(new_data, new_capacity);
    throw;
  }

  // got here only if no exception was thrown
  for (i = 0; i < size(); ++i)
    alloc_traits::destroy(m_data[i]);
  alloc_traits::deallocate(m_data, m_capacity);

  m_data     = new_data;
  m_capacity = new_capacity;
}
```

The use of `T`'s move constructor often yields algorithmic performance
advantages over using its copy constructor, sometimes reducing the cost from
*O(N)* or worse per copy to *O(1)*. The move constructor, however, often
modifies the original object; if the move constructor might throw, `vector`
must degenerate to using the copy constructor, giving up the performance gain
to ensure that it can leave the original object in its initial state.  Because
`vector<T, A>::reallocate` is a *generic* function, using `std::move` and
retaining the strong guarantee in the code above would be impossible if we did
not have the `noexcept` operator.

The Lakos Rule
--------------

Since the `noexcept` annotation was added late in the C++11 cycle and was thus
brand new and not fully
understood, applying it appropriately in the Standard Library was a
challenge. John Lakos and Alisdair Meredith proposed what has become known as
the *Lakos Rule* (described in [N3279](http://wg21.link/N3279) and extended in
[P0884](http://wg21.link/P0884)).  Summarized below, the Lakos Rule provided a
safe framework for deciding whether a specific function should be declared
`noexcept`.

 * If a function has no preconditions (a *wide contract*) and is guaranteed not
   to throw, then declare it `noexcept`.
 * If a function has preconditions (a *narrow contract*) or it might
   throw when called correctly (*in contract*), then do not declare it
   `noexcept` (or declare it `noexcept(false)`).

The example below shows a subset of the `std::vector` interface. Note that only
`size()`, which promises not to throw and has no preconditions, is declared
`noexcept`, whereas the others each fail one or both of the Lakos-Rule tests
and are thus not `noexcept`.

```C++
template <class T, class A>
class vector {
   // ...
   constexpr size_type size() const noexcept; // wide contract,   doesn't throw
   constexpr reference at(size_type);         // wide contract,   might throw
   constexpr reference operator[](size_type); // narrow contract, doesn't throw
   constexpr reference front();               // narrow contract, doesn't throw
};
```

Resistance to the Lakos Rule
----------------------------

Although the Lakos Rule is effective and has strong theoretical and practical
underpinnings (see [P2861](http://wg21.link/P2861)), two reasons have emerged
for violating it in the Standard Library design.

 1. Under many (but by no means all) circumstances, calling a `noexcept`
    function
    generates less code.  Thus, programmers --- both within and outside WG21
    --- want to use `noexcept` to improve code generation, yet
    the author has seen no compelling evidence that `noexcept` produces
    measurably *faster* code on any modern platforms.

 2. Within WG21, there has been concern that the distinction between
    "*Throws*: nothing" and `noexcept` is unclear (see
    [P1656](http://wg21.link/P1656)).

As tempting as it might be, violating the Lakos rule is ill advised unless a
compelling case can be made that querying the function with the `noexcept`
operator is necessary for optimizing or ensuring correctness of an algorithm
at compile time. As described in [P2861](http://wg21.link/P2861), if `noexcept`
is added to a
function in one version of the Standard, it cannot be removed in a future
version without potentially breaking code.  Specifically,
widening the contract of a function to add new functionality is safe,
provided that every program written for the old version has the same
observable behavior when compiled with the new version, but if the
old version is annotated with `noexcept`, the new version cannot be
widened to accept new values that would result in an exception being thrown.

Moreover, a defensive programming library (or language contract facility) might
want to throw an exception on a contract violation, especially when testing the
procondition checks themselves.  The `noexcept` specifier interferes with such
a facility (see [P2831](http://wg21.link/P2831)).

Serving the multiverse
----------------------

The goal of this proposal is to address the constituencies within the different
C++ universes (the C++ multiverse) that have been ill served by `noexcept`
alone, such as embedded developers who want smaller code and unit-testers who
want to throw on contract violations.  What is needed is a way to provide the
desired code-generation and documentation benefits of `noexcept` without
violating either the spirit or the letter of the Lakos Rule.

### The embedded development universe

The reduction in generated-code size that usually results from annotating a
called function with `noexcept` or `[[throws_nothing]]` has the most impact in
memory-constrained environments.  It is often asserted that embedded developers
turn off exceptions in their builds because the code-size cost of leaving them
enabled is too large. Unfortunately, this has led to a self-fulfilling
prophesy: WG21 does nothing to make exceptions friendlier for embedded
programmers, so embedded programmers, in turn, eschew exceptions.

Remembering that even an embedded processor may have several megabytes of RAM,
it is not always necessary to completely turn off exceptions. Used
appropriately, the `[[throws_nothing]]` attribute can reduce the size of an
executable while being true to the best design practices, including following
the Lakos Rule.

### The unit testing universe

Many defensive-programming libraries comprise an `assert`-like macro and a
custom function to handle assertion failures:

```C++
void assert_failure_handler(const char* file, unsigned line, const char* func,
                            const char* expression)
{
  std::cerr << file << ':' << line << ": in function " << func
            << ": assertion failure " << expression << std::endl;

  throw std::logic_error(expression);
}

#ifdef CHECKED_MODE
# define ASSERT(cond) cond ? (void) 0 : \
    assert_failure_handler(__FILE__, __LINE__, __FUNCTION__, #cond)
#else
# define ASSERT(cond) (void) 0
#endif
```

Now, imagine an integer absolute-value function, `intAbs`, having the
precondition that the input is not `INT_MIN`, because the absolute value of
`INT_MIN` is not representable in an `int`. When called in contract, `intAbs`
does not throw an exception, so it is declared with
`[[throws_nothing]]`. Within the function body, `intAbs` checks its
precondition using the above `ASSERT`:

```C++
// Return absolute value of x.  Precondition: x is not `INT_MIN`.
[[throws_nothing]] int intAbs(int x)
{
    ASSERT(x != INT_MIN);
    return x < 0 ? -x : x;
}
```

A test engineer wants to verify that precondition violations are correctly
detected.  Using a throwing failure handler (as shown in
`assert_failure_handler`, above), the test engineer writes a negative test that
deliberately violates the precondition:

```C++
bool testPreconditionViolation()
{
  bool success = false;
  try {
    intAbs(INT_MIN);
    return false; // Failed to catch the precondition violation.
  }
  catch (const std::logic_error&) {
    return true;  // Successfully caught the precondition violation.
  }
}
```

To trigger the precondition check without terminating the test program,
`[[throws_nothing]]` must allow the `logic_error` exception to escape. The test
engineer would thus choose an implementation that ignores `[[throws_nothing]]`,
thus allowing exceptions to propagate.


### The library specification universe

A number of features in C++ that are intended to reduce errors or improve code
generation have the side-effect of making code more self-documenting. For
example, `const` indicates --- to both the compiler and human reader --- that a
variable's value will not change and the `assert` macro documents an invariant
of an algorithm in a way that is enforceable at run time. Similarly,
`[[throws_nothing]]` indicates, at a glance, that a function will not throw
when called in contract; both the implementation and the human reader benefit.

Within the C++ Standard Library, functions having "*Throws*: nothing" as part
of their description could be annotated with `[[throws_nothing]]`. Whether such
a practice would add clarity is a matter for LWG to decide.


Proposed Feature
================

A Standard attribute, tentatively named `[[throws_nothing]]` and appertaining
to function declarations, is proposed to indicate that a function is specified
not to throw when all of its preconditions are met (i.e., it is called *in
contract*):

```C++
[[throws_nothing]] void f(int);
```

The presence of the `[[throws_nothing]]` attribute cannot be queried by the
program itself at compile-time; the result of the `noexcept` operator and the
function type are unchanged:

```C++
[[throws_nothing]] void g1(int);
static_assert(noexcept(g1(0)) == false);

[[throws_nothing]] void g2(int) noexcept;
static_assert(noexcept(g2(0)) == true);

[[throws_nothing]] void g3(int) noexcept(false);
static_assert(noexcept(g3(0)) == false);

void g4(int);
static_assert(std::is_same_v<decltype(g1), decltype(g4)>);
```

Intentionally making `[[throws_nothing]]` invisible to the `noexcept` operator
prevents using it to select an algorithm at compile time; the attribute does
not change the *essential behavior*[^essential] of a correct program and can be
removed from a subsequent version of a function, provided the behavior of the
function does not change for any previously valid inputs.

[^essential]: Essential behavior comprises the promised behavior of a function
when called in contract.  The return value, guaranteed side-effects, and
complexity guaranties are part of essential behavior.  The layout of objects,
number of instructions executed, and logging are rarely part of its essential
behavior. The effects of calling the function out of contract are *never* part
of essential behavior.

If a `[[throws_nothing]]` function attempts to exit with an exception, it is
implementation defined whether `std::terminate` is called or whether the
annotation is ignored (and the exception propagates normally). The recommended
best practice is to make both semantics available to the user, with terminate
semantics being the default. However, if the function is also annotated with
`noexcept` or `noexcept(true)`, `std::terminate` is always called.

By making the behavior of an incorrect program --- one that attempts to throw
from a `[[throws_nothing]]` function --- implementation defined, rather than
always terminating, the behavior can vary to serve the multiple constituencies
of the C++ multiverse. On an implementation that calls `std::terminate`, a call
to a function annotated with `[[throws_nothing]]` is likely to result in
smaller generated code compared to one with no annotation at all. Conversely,
an implementation that ignores the attribute allows testing of throwing
defensive checks on a function that otherwise would not throw.

As with `noexcept`, implementations of the Standard Library would be permitted
to use `[[throws_nothing]]` for any nonthrowing function, even if the Standard
itself does not mandate its use. In fact, for discretionary use by
implementations, `[[throws_nothing]]` is much better than the `noexcept`
specifier because `[[throws_nothing]]` cannot inadvertently change the meaning
of a correct program and is responsive to the settings used to build the
program.


Feature comparison
------------------

For functions that promise not to throw, the table below compares
`[[throws_nothing]]` to `noexcept` and to using no annotation at all
(*unmarked*). *If terminate* means yes for implementations that terminate un
unexpected exceptions and no otherwise. *If ignore* means yes for
implementations that ignore the annotation and no otherwise.  The purpose of
the
table is not to show that one annotation is better than the other, but that,
despite some overlap, they serve different purposes and therefore support
different use cases, none of which violate the Lakos Rule.

| Supports compile-time algorithm selection | no      | yes        | no                   |

Syntax and spelling
-------------------

The `[[throws_nothing]]` annotation fits well with the conventional notion of
an attribute: Removing the attribute has no essential effect on a correct
program (see [P2552](http://wg21.link/P2552)). Rendering this functionality as
a keyword or contextual keyword seems unnecessary.

Though putting the `[[throws_nothing]]` attribute in the same location as
`noexcept` would seem logical, for an attribute to appertain to a function, the
attribute must occur either before the function declaration or immediately
after the function identifier:

```C++
[[throws_nothing]] void f(int);   // OK
void g [[throws_nothing]] (int);  // OK
void h(int) [[throws_nothing]];   // not proper attribute placement
```

The original spelling for the attribute was `[[does_not_throw]]`, which happens
to have the same number of characters as `[[throws_nothing]]`. The name was
changed to `[[throws_nothing]]` to match the "*Throws*: nothing" phrasing that
LWG uses when documenting functions that do not throw.

This paper does not propose the ability to make `[[throws_nothing]]`
conditional on a compile-time constant Boolean property, like the `noexcept`
clause is. Such functionality seems counterintuitive; this proposal
deliberately omits any method for querying the `[[throws_nothing]]` attribute,
thus the common idiom of
wrapping a function and propagating its `noexcept` property has no equivalent
for the `[[throws_nothing]]` attribute.  Nevertheless, if conditional
functionality is found to be useful (now or in the future), the syntax can be
extended with a parameter, i.e.,
`[[throws_nothing(` *constant-bool-expression* `)]]`.

Alternatives Considered
=======================

Switching `noexcept` on and off with a constant expression
----------------------------------------------------------

One use of `[[does_not_throw]]` is to allow defensive checks to throw an
exception through an otherwise-nonthrowing interface. One proposed way to
achieve this behavior for non-throwing functions is to use `noexcept` in such a
way that it can be turned off when desired.  This approach can be implemented
with help of the preprocessor. For example, using the framework described in
[The unit testing universe](the-unit-testing-universe) section, `noexcept` can
be turned off when `CHECKED_MODE` is defined:

```C++
#ifdef CHECKED_MODE
inline constexpr bool does_not_throw = false;
#else
inline constexpr bool does_not_throw = true;
#endif

void f(int i) noexcept(does_not_throw)  // BAD IDEA!
{
  ASSERT(i < 0);
  // ...
}
```

With this approach, the expression `noexcept(f(0))` will yield different
results depending on the `CHECKED_MODE` macro, possibly resulting in different
logic paths
for debug and release builds, and thus violate the principle that essential
behavior must not be changed by build modes --- a principle convincingly
advocated for in [P2831RO](http://wg21.link/P2831R0) and
[P2834R0](http://wg21.link/P2834R0) and named, by the latter, *Build-Mode
Independence*.

Effects on the Standard Library
===============================

No changes would be needed immediately in the C++23 Standard Library if
`[[throws_nothing]]` were adopted. LWG can discuss whether to replace or
augment "*Throws*: nothing" in the description with `[[throws_nothing]]` in the
interface of functions having narrow contracts that promise not to throw when
called in contract.

An immediate change to the C++26 Working Paper might be necessary if any
narrow-contract functions
targeted for C++26 are currently annotated with `noexcept`; perhaps those
annotations should be changed to `[[throws_nothing]]` or perhaps the Standard
should omit the annotation and leave it up to the implementation to decide
whether to use `[[throws_nothing]]`.  Violations of the Lakos Rule already in
C++23 could be handled on a case-by-case basis (via DRs). Minimizing such
violations would result in greater stability across implementations and
versions of the Standard.


Implementation Experience
=========================

At present, no compilers implement this feature. If this paper receives a
favorable response in EWGI, we will implement the proposed facility before
presenting
it to EWG. Implementation is expected to be a fairly simple delta on the
existing implementation of `noexcept`.


Formal Wording
==============

Wording will be provided after EWGI shows initial interest, i.e., after a
positive result in an encourages-more-work poll.
