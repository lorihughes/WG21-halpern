Abstract
========

The `noexcept` function annotation and companion `noexcept` operator were
invented to allow containers such `vector` to provide the strong exception
guarantee when performing operations that require relocating existing
elements. The `noexcept` annotation has since been utilized to improve code
generation and, sometimes, as a form of documentation.  The problems with these
off-label uses have been known for a long time; the so-called *Lakos Rule* was
intended to prevent such use (or misuse) within the C++ Standard Library.  In
this paper, I propose an annotation for non-throwing functions to be used
instead of `noexcept` in circumstances where the latter is undesirable --
specifically, when the function in question has a *narrow contract*.  Although
not part of the simple and minimal proposal presented, this paper also explores
how this alternative nothrow facility could eventually be integrated with a
future contracts facility.

Brief Summary
=============

I propose an annotation, e.g., `[[throws_nothing]]`, indicating that a
function does not throw when called correctly (*in contract*). Unlike
`noexcept` the `[[throws_nothing]]` annotation cannot be detected by the
`noexcept` operator:

```C++
void f(int) [[throws_nothing]];
static_assert(noexcept(f(0)) == false);
```

Thus, `[[throws_nothing]]` can be added or removed from a function declaration
without affecting program logic.

Motivation
==========

* The `noexcept` specifier was introduced at the end of the C++11 cycle for one
  purpose: to enable the safe use of move constructors in `vector`-like
  containers that offer the *strong exception guarantee* for some operations.

  * When move constructor is `noexcept`, use it.
  * Otherwise, use the copy constructor to allow rollback.
  * To enable this compile-time algorithm choice, the `noexcept()` operator
    yields a compile-time `bool` value that can be used for dispatch.

```C++
[       Sample code illustrating `noexcept()` dispatch goes here. ]
```

* Being late in the C++11 cycle, adding the brand-new and not fully understood
  `noexcept` appropriately throughout the standard library was a
  challenge. John Lakos proposed, and the committee accepted, what has become
  known as the *Lakos Rule* for deciding whether or not a specific operation
  should be declared `noexcept`:

   * If it has no preconditions (i.e., it has a *wide contract*) and it does not
     throw, then declare it `noexcept`.
   * If it has preconditions (i.e., it has a *narrow contract*) or it might
     throw when called correctly (*in contract*), then do not declare it
     `noexcept`.

```C++
template <class T, class A>
class vector {
   // ...
   constexpr size_type size() noexcept;       // wide contract,   doesn't throw
   constexpr reference at(size_type);         // wide contract,   might throw
   constexpr reference operator[](size_type); // narrow contract, doesn't throw
};
```

* Although it is an effective rule, with strong theoretical and practical
  underpinnings (see below), two reasons emerged for violating the Lakos Rule
  in the Standard Library design:

   1. It was discovered that under many (but not all) circumstances, that
      calling a `noexcept` function would generate less code.  Thus, programmers
      -- both within and outside of WG21 -- wanted to use `noexcept` to improve
      codegen.

   2. Within WG21, it irks some that a function marked "*Throws*: nothing"
      does not simply have a `noexcept` annotation.

* As tempting as it might be, violating the Lakos rule is usually ill-advised.

   * If `noexcept` is added to a function in one version of the Standard, it
     cannot be removed in future versions without breaking code.

       * In general, it is safe to widen the contract of a function to add
         functionality. The new version is *Liskov Subtitutable* for old one.
       * The use of `noexcept` on narrow contracts constrains future versions.
       * See [Lakos93]().

   * A defensive programming library or language contract facility might want
     to throw an exception on a contract violation, especially for testing the
     contract checks itself.  `noexcept` interferes with such a facility.  See
     [Doumler93]().

Proposed Feature
================

As stated earlier, what is being proposed is a standard attribute,
`[[throws_nothing]]` that indicates that a function does not throw when called
in contract. The behavior of such a function would be *implementation defined*
if an attempt is made to throw an exception from within the
function. By making the behavior implementation defined, rather than specifying
either UB or a specific action such as `std::terminate()`, we allow the behavior
to vary based on optimization-level or other compiler settings (build modes).

Critical to this feature is that it cannot be detected by the program itself at
compile time. Unlike `noexcept`, it does not change the behavior of a correct
program and can be removed in future versions of a function. It does not change
the type of the function and it cannot be used to change an algorithm at compile
time.

Advantages over no annotation
-----------------------------

* Documents the nonthrowing nature of the function

* Allows the compiler to generate smaller (and occasionally faster) code

* Allows the compiler to generate safer code by, e.g., terminating the program
  if an exception is thrown.

Advantages over `noexcept`
--------------------------

* Future-compatible with future versions of the same function that might throw
  when called in contract

* Allows for build modes where defensive checks might throw, allowing programs
  to "recover" from logic errors (or at least fail more gracefully)

* Can be used on narrow contracts without violating the Lakos Rule

Build modes
-----------

Build modes are not part of the C++ standard, but their existence can be
implied. Initially, I would expect (and encourage) every compiler to provide at
least two build modes that affect the behavior of attempting to throw from a
`[[throws_nothing]]` function:

1. **Terminate**: Call `std::terminate` just like `noexcept` does.

2. **Ignore/rethrow**: Allow the exception to escape, as though the annotation
   were not present.

There are other options, some of which are described in the
[Future Integration with Contracts](#future-integration-with-contracts)
section, below.

Syntax and spelling
-------------------

The `[[throws_nothing]]` attribute proposed here would be allowed in the same
location as `noexcept`.  In fact, it might make sense to use them together,
especially for conditional `noexcept` clauses. Although this syntactic location
seems intuitive to me, I am open to arguments that it should go somewhere else,
such as at the start of a function declaration.

The `[[throws_nothing]]` annotation fits well with the conventional notion of
an attribute: removing the attribute has no essential effect on a correct
program. I am open to the idea, however, that it should be a keyword or
contextual keyword.

Some alternative spellings have been considered:

* `[[does_not_throw]]`
* `throws_nothing` (keyword or contextual keyword)
* `does_not_throw` (keyword or contextual keyword)

This paper does not propose the ability to make `[[does_not_throw]]`
conditional a constant (Boolean) property, the way the `noexcept` clause can.  If
that functionality is desired (now or in the future), the syntax can be
extended with a parameter, i.e., `[[does_not_throw(` *boolean-expression* `)]]`.

Alternatives Considered
=======================

Switching `noexcept` on and off with a constant expression
----------------------------------------------------------

One use of `[[does_not_throw]]` is to allow defensive checks to throw an
exception through an otherwise-nonthrowing interface. One proposed way to get
this behavior in certain build modes is to use `noexcept` in such a way that it
can be turned off for certain functions.  This approach can be implemented with
help of the preprocessor:

```C++
#ifdef CHECKED_MODE
inline constexpr bool does_not_throw = false;
#define ASSERT(cond) if (! (cond)) throw std::logic_error(#cond)
#else
inline constexpr bool does_not_throw = true;
#define ASSERT(cond) (void) 0
#endif

void f(int i) noexcept(does_not_throw)  // BAD IDEA!
{
  ASSERT(i < 0);
  // ...
}
```

The problem with this approach is that the expression `noexcept(f(0))` will
yield different results in different build modes, possibly resulting in
different logic paths for debug and release builds.

Extending the `noexcept` syntax
-------------------------------

Instead of a separate attribute or keyword, the `noexcept` annotation could be
extended in some way.  For example, instead of a Boolean argument, a
three-state argument could be used to specify `noexcept(true)`,
`noexcept(false)`, or `[[throws_nothing]]` semantics.

Alternatively, a new token could be inserted into or around `noxcept`, e.g.,
`noexcept(true, uncheckable)`.

While these spellings achieve the goals of this paper, they seem weird and hard
to specify. They do, however, have the advantage of unifying the two
similar-but-not-identical features.


Future Integration with Contracts
=================================

As the contract facility takes shape, we would want to ensure that the
`[[throws_nothing]]` facility evolves in such a way as to make the combination
as powerful and consistent as possible.  Specifically,

* `[[throws_nothing]]` describes a sort of postcondition, i.e., that the
   function did not exit via an exception. If possible, its syntax should be
   harmonious with contract annotations. If the latter uses a non-attribute
   syntax, then *throws-nothing* should use a similar syntax (assuming the two
   features first ship in the same standard).

* Related to the preceding, an exception trying to escape a
  `[[throws_nothing]]` function, should be treated as a contract violation,
  resulting in a call to the violation handler.  Thus, in addition to propagate
  or terminate, an integrated facility would also have a convert-to-violation
  mode.

* In a build mode where contract-checks are enabled and a throwing
  contract-violation handler is installed, `[[throws_nothing]]` should allow
  exceptions to escape the function.  A high-quality implementation would
  recognize the interaction such that exceptions thrown from the
  contract-violation handler are propagated unchanged and other exceptions are
  converted into contract violations.

* If contract annotations are given additional controls, many of those controls
  should also apply to `[[throws_nothing]]`:

```C++
void f(int) [[ throws_nothing ]];          // Obey global build mode
void g(int) [[ throws_nothing audit ]];    // Only observed in audit build mode
void h(int) [[ throws_nothing enforce ]];  // Always enforced
void j(int) [[ throws_nothing assume ]];   // Assume no-throw; don't check
```

The last example (function `j`) would generate the smallest code because
neither the caller nor callee would need to generate any exception-handling
code. It is also the least safe because, just as in the case of other contract
annotations, assuming something that turns out to be false will typically
result in undefined behavior.

Affects on the Standard library
===============================

No changes would be needed immediately in the Standard Library if this facility
were adopted. If LWG wants to, it can use the new annotation instead of, or in
addition to "*Throws*: nothing" for functions having narrow contracts that
don't throw when called in contract.

The one place where immediate change might be necessary is that if there are
any narrow-contract functions targeted for C++26 that are currently annotated
with `noexcept`, we probably want to change those annotations to
`[[throws_nothing]]`.


Implementation Experience
=========================

At present, no compilers implement this feature. If this paper receives a
favorable response in EWGI, we will make sure to implement it before presenting
it to EWG. Implementation is expected to be a fairly simple delta on the
existing implementation of `noexcept`.


Formal wording
==============

TBD: Wording will be provided after EWGI shows initial interest, i.e., after a
positive result in an "encourages more work" poll.
