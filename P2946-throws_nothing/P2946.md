Abstract
========

The `noexcept` function specifier and companion `noexcept` operator were
invented to allow containers such `vector` to provide the strong
exception-safety guarantee when performing operations that require relocating
existing elements. The `noexcept` specifier has since been utilized to improve
code generation and, sometimes, as a form of documentation.  The problems with
these off-label uses have been known for a long time; the so-called *Lakos
Rule*, which predated the release of C++11, was intended to prevent such use
(or misuse) within the C++ Standard Library.  In this paper, I propose an
annotation for non-throwing functions to be used instead of `noexcept` in
circumstances where the latter is undesirable -- specifically, when the
function in question has a *narrow contract*.  Although not part of the simple
and minimal proposal presented, this paper also explores how this alternative
throws-nothing facility could eventually be integrated with a future contracts
facility.

Brief Summary
=============

I propose an annotation in the form of an attribute, `[[throws_nothing]]`,
indicating that a function does not throw when called properly (*in
contract*):

```C++
[[throws_nothing]] void f(int);
static_assert(noexcept(f(0)) == false);
```

Importantly, this proposed `[[throws_nothing]]` attribute, unlike the
`noexcept` specifier, is intentionally invisible to the `noexcept` operator; it
does not affect *essential behavior* and may be ignored by some platforms,
depending on the build mode. `[[throws_nothing]]` can, therefore, be added to
or removed from a function declaration without affecting program logic.

An expanded description of this proposal is in the
[Proposed Feature](#proposed-feature) section.

Motivation
==========

Purpose of `noexcept`
---------------------

The `noexcept` specifier was introduced at the end of the C++11 cycle for one
purpose: to enable the safe use of move constructors in `vector`-like
containers that offer the *strong exception-safety guarantee* for certain
operations, such as inserting elements at the end.  The problem was first
described, and `noexcept` was first proposed, in
[N2855](http://wg21.link/n2855). The proposed `noexcept` wording was later
refined, eventually resulting in the final wording in
[N3050](http://wg21.link/n3050).

Below is one possible implementation of a vector-reallocation function, which
is required to leave the original vector unchanged if an exception is thrown
while trying to move elements from the old buffer to the new one. This
implementation uses `if constexpr` instead of the `std::move_if_noexcept`
function to make the two different code paths easier to distinguish.

```C++
template <class T, class A>
void vector<T,A>::reallocate(size_type new_capacity)
{
  using alloc_traits = allocator_traits<A>;

  pointer new_data = alloc_traits::allocate(new_capacity);

  size_type i = 0;
  if constexpr (noexcept(T(std::move(m_data[i])))) {
    for (i = 0; i < size(); ++i)
      alloc_traits::construct(&new_data[i], std::move(m_data[i])); // efficient
  }
  else try {
    for (i = 0; i < size(); ++i)
      alloc_traits::construct(&new_data[i], m_data[i]);  // Copy (less efficient)
  }
  catch (...) {
    while (i)
      alloc_traits::destroy(new_data[--i]);
    alloc_traits::deallocate(new_data, new_capacity);
    throw;
  }

  // Got here only if no exception was thrown
  for (i = 0; i < size(); ++i)
    alloc_traits::destroy(m_data[i]);
  alloc_traits::deallocate(m_data, m_capacity);

  m_data     = new_data;
  m_capacity = new_capacity;
}
```

The use of `T`'s move constructor often yields algorithmic performance
advantages over using its copy constructor, sometimes reducing the cost from
*O(N)* or worse per copy to *O(1)*. The move constructor modifies the original
object however; if the move constructor might throw, `vector` must degenerate
to using the copy constructor, giving up the performance gain in order to
ensure that it can leave the original object in its initial state. Because
this is a *generic context*, it would be impossible to use `std::move` and
retain the strong guarantee in the code above if we did not have the `noexcept`
operator.

The Lakos Rule
--------------

Being late in the C++11 cycle, applying the brand-new, and not fully
understood, `noexcept` annotation appropriately in the standard library was a
challenge. John Lakos and Alisdair Meredith proposed what has become known as
the *Lakos Rule* (described [N3279](http://wg21.link/N3279) and extended in
[P0884](http://wg21.link/P0884).  Summarized below, the Lakos Rule provided a
safe framework for deciding whether a specific function should be declared
`noexcept`:

 * If it has no preconditions (a *wide contract*) and is guaranteed not to
   throw, then declare it `noexcept`.
 * If it has preconditions (a *narrow contract*) or it might
   throw when called correctly (*in contract*), then do not declare it
   `noexcept` (or declare it `noexcept(false)`).

The example below shows a subset of the `std::vector` interface. Note
that only `size()`, which promises not to throw and has no preconditions, is
declared `noexcept` whereas `at` and `operator[]` fail one of the tests and are
thus not `noexcept`.

```C++
template <class T, class A>
class vector {
   // ...
   constexpr size_type size() const noexcept; // wide contract,   doesn't throw
   constexpr reference at(size_type);         // wide contract,   might throw
   constexpr reference operator[](size_type); // narrow contract, doesn't throw
};
```

Resistance to the Lakos Rule
----------------------------

Although it is an effective rule, with strong theoretical and practical
underpinnings (see [P2861](http://wg21.link/P2861)), two reasons have emerged
for violating the Lakos Rule in the Standard Library design:

 1. Under many (but by no means all) circumstances, calling a `noexcept`
    function
    generates less code.  Thus, programmers -- both within and outside of WG21
    -- want to use `noexcept` to improve code generation. It is important to
    note that I've seen no compelling evidence that `noexcept` produces
    measurably *faster* code with any modern compilers.

 2. Within WG21, it had been brought up that the distinction between
    "*Throws*: nothing" and `noexcept` is unclear (see
    [P1656](http://wg21.link/P1656)).

As tempting as it might be, violating the Lakos rule is ill-advised unless a
compelling case can be made that querying the function with the `noexcept`
operator is necessary for optimizing or ensuring correctness of an algorithm
at compile-time. As described in [P2861](http://wg21.link/P2861), if `noexcept`
is added to a
function in one version of the Standard, it cannot be removed in a future
version without potentially breaking code.  Specifically, it
is safe to widen the contract of a function to add new functionality,
provided that every program written for the old version has the same
observable behavior when compiled with the new version, but if the
old version is annotated with `noexcept`, the new version cannot be
widened to accept new values that would result in an exception being thrown.

Moreover, a defensive programming library or language contract facility might
want to throw an exception on a contract violation, especially when testing the
contract checks themselves.  The `noexcept` specifier interferes with such a
facility (see [P2831](http://wg21.link/P2831)).


Proposed Feature
================

What is needed is a way to provide the desired code-generation and
documentation benefits of `noexcept` described in the
[Resistance to the Lakos Rule](#resistance-to-the-lakos-rule) section without
violating either the spirit or the letter of the Lakos Rule. The goal is to
address the constituencies within the C++ "multiverse" that have been
ill-served by `noexcept` alone, such as embedded developers who want smaller
code and unit-testers who want to throw on contract violations.

The proposed standard attribute, tentatively named `[[throws_nothing]]`,
indicates that a function promises not to throw when called in contract. If the
function exits via a thrown exception, the behavior is *implementation
defined*.  Critical to the `[[throws_nothing]]` feature is that its use cannot
be detected by the program itself at compile time; the result of the `noexcept`
operator is unchanged by this attribute. The `[[throws_nothing]]` attribute
does not change the type of the function, and it cannot be used to select an
algorithm at compile time.

`[[throws_nothing]]` does not change the behavior of a correct program and can
be removed in future versions of a function, provided the behavior of the
function does not change for any previously valid inputs.  By making the
behavior of an incorrect program --- one that attempts to throw from a
`[[throws_nothing]]` function --- implementation defined, rather than
specifying an action such as `std::terminate()` or letting the behavior be
undefined, we allow the behavior to vary based on optimization level or other
compiler settings (*build modes*).

A call to a function annotated with `[[throws_nothing]]` is likely to result is
smaller generated code, compared to one with no annotation at
all. Additionally, the implementation has latitude to generate *safer* code, by
detecting an attempt to exit such a function via an exception and taking a
fail-safe action such as terminating or invoking some user-defined violation
handler (see the
[Future Integration with Contracts](#future-integration-with-contracts)
section, below). The always-terminate behavior of `noexcept` is known to be
safer than UB, but might still be unsafe in a critical system that must not
terminate. The `[[throws_nothing]]` specification allows implementations to
provide better choices for various use cases. In a debugging environment, an
implementation can provide stack dumps or trigger the debugger as soon as it
detects that an exception might escape a `[[throws_nothing]]` boundary.

As with `noexcept`, implementations of the Standard Library would be permitted
to use `[[throws_nothing]]` for any non-throwing function, even if the Standard
itself does not mandate its use. In fact, `[[throws_nothing]]` is much better
for discretionary use by implementations than is the `noexcept` specifier
because it cannot inadvertently change the meaning of a program and is
responsive to the settings used to build the program.

Feature comparison
------------------

For functions that promise not to throw, the table below compares
`[[throws_nothing]]` against `noexcept` and using no annotation at
all (*unmarked*). "Mode-dependent" is a shorthand for "implementation-defined," where
implementations are expected to provide several build modes (see
[Build modes](#build-modes), below). The purpose of the
table is not to show that one annotation is better than the other, but that,
despite some overlap, they serve different purposes and therefore support
different use cases, none of which violate the Lakos Rule.

| Supports compile-time algorithm selection | no      | yes        | no                   |

Build modes
-----------

Build modes are not part of the C++ standard, but their existence can be
implied. Initially, it would be expected (and encouraged) that every
implementation
provide at least two build modes affecting the behavior of attempting to exit
a `[[throws_nothing]]` function via an exception:

1. **Terminate**: Call `std::terminate` just like `noexcept` does.

2. **Ignore/rethrow**: Allow the exception to escape, as though the annotation
   were not present.

There are other options, some of which are described in the
[Future Integration with Contracts](#future-integration-with-contracts)
section, below.

Mixing build modes can be dangerous, as a caller that is built in *terminate*
mode might exhibit UB when calling a `[[throws_nothing]]` function in a
different translation unit that was built in *ignore* mode. An implementation
could use name mangling to ensure that such a mixed-mode program will not
link. Alternatively, the implementation could always generate a "safe" version
that terminates in addition to any other version, again using name mangling to
ensure that the correct version is seen by the caller. The Standard, not
recognizing build modes, would have nothing to say on that subject.

Syntax and spelling
-------------------

The `[[throws_nothing]]` annotation fits well with the conventional notion of
an attribute: removing the attribute has no essential effect on a correct
program (see [P2552](http://wg21.link/P2552)). Rendering this functionality as
a keyword or contextual keyword seems unnecessary.

While it would seem logical to put the `[[throws_nothing]]` attribute in the
same location as `noexcept`, in order for an attribute to appertain to a
function, it must go either before the function declaration or immediately
after the function identifier:

```C++
[[throws_nothing]] void f(int);   // OK
void g [[throws_nothing]] (int);  // OK
void h(int) [[throws_nothing]];   // Not proper attribute placement
```

The original spelling for the attribute was `[[does_not_throw]]`, which happens
to be the same number of characters as `[[throws_nothing]]`. The name was
changed to `[[throws_nothing]]` to match the "*Throws*: nothing" phrasing that
LWG uses when documenting functions that do not throw.

This paper does not propose the ability to make `[[throws_nothing]]`
conditional on a compile-time constant Boolean property, the way the `noexcept`
clause is. Such functionality seems counter-intuitive; there is deliberately no
way to query the `[[throws_nothing]]` attribute, so the common idiom of
wrapping a function and propagating its `noexcept` property has no equivalent
for the `[[throws_nothing]]` attribute.  Nevertheless, if conditional
functionality is found to be useful (now or in the future), the syntax can be
extended with a parameter, i.e.,
`[[throws_nothing(` *constant-bool-expression* `)]]`.

Alternatives Considered
=======================

Switching `noexcept` on and off with a constant expression
----------------------------------------------------------

One use of `[[does_not_throw]]` is to allow defensive checks to throw an
exception through an otherwise-non-throwing interface. One proposed way to get
this behavior in certain build modes is to use `noexcept` in such a way that it
can be turned off for certain functions.  This approach can be implemented with
help of the preprocessor:

```C++
#ifdef CHECKED_MODE
inline constexpr bool does_not_throw = false;
#define ASSERT(cond) if (! (cond)) throw std::logic_error(#cond)
#else
inline constexpr bool does_not_throw = true;
#define ASSERT(cond) (void) 0
#endif

void f(int i) noexcept(does_not_throw)  // BAD IDEA!
{
  ASSERT(i < 0);
  // ...
}
```

With this approach, the expression `noexcept(f(0))` will yield different
results in different build modes, possibly resulting in different logic paths
for debug and release builds, and violating the principle that essential
behavior must not be changed by build modes --- a principle convincingly
advocated for in [P2834R0](http://wg21.link/P2834R0) and named "Build-Mode
Independence."

Future Integration with Contracts
=================================

There are a number of ways by which proposed contract facility (see
[P2900](http:://wg21.link/P2900)) and the `[[throws_nothing]]` facility
overlap, and suggestions have emerged whereby these features can be harmonized,
resulting in a more powerful and consistent Standard:

* `[[throws_nothing]]` can be considered a special type of contract check ---
  similar to the Contracts proposal's `pre` and `post` --- but evaluated at a
  distinct time, i.e., when an exception tries to escape. The proposed
  Contracts facility gives the programmer control, by means of a
  user-replaceable violation handler, over how detected logic errors are dealt
  with, e.g., logging and terminating, logging and somehow continuing, etc.
  It would be a powerful feature to afford the user the same level of control
  over how an escaping exception is handled in a `[[throws_nothing]]`
  context. Thus, in addition to propagate or terminate, an integrated facility
  might also have a convert-to-contract-violation mode.

* Integration between `[[throws_nothing]]` and contract annotations would be more
  seamless if their syntaxes were harmonized. If Contracts end up using a
  non-attribute syntax, then *throws-nothing* might use a similar syntax
  (assuming the two features first ship in the same standard). As described
  earlier, `[[throws_nothing]]` cannot go at the end of a function declaration
  (my preferred position) and still appertain to the function, in today's C++.
  Pre- and post-condition annotations will almost certainly go after the
  function declaration, however, so `[[throws_nothing]]` could conceivably go
  along for the ride.

* In a build mode where contract-checks are enabled and a throwing
  contract-violation handler is installed, the programmer would want
  contract-violation exceptions to be allowed to escape a `[[throws_nothing]]`,
  rather than terminating. If we integrate `[[throws_nothing]]` with Contracts,
  the compiler could automatically figure out that we are using a
  contract-checking build mode and allow exceptions to escape a
  `[[throws_nothing]]` function.

* If contract annotations are given additional controls, many of those controls
  might also apply to `[[throws_nothing]]`:

```C++
void f(int) [[ throws_nothing ]];          // Obey global build mode
void g(int) [[ throws_nothing audit ]];    // Only observed in audit build mode
void h(int) [[ throws_nothing enforce ]];  // Always enforced
void j(int) [[ throws_nothing assume ]];   // Assume non-throwing; don't check
```

The final line above (function `j`) would generate the smallest code because
neither the caller nor callee would need to generate any exception-handling
code. It is also the least safe because, just as in the case of other contract
annotations, assuming something that turns out to be false would result in
(language) undefined behavior.

Effects on the Standard library
===============================

No changes would be needed immediately in the Standard Library if this facility
were adopted. LWG can discuss whether to replace or augment "*Throws*:
nothing" in the description with `[[throws_nothing]]` in the interface of
functions having narrow contracts that promise not to throw when called in
contract.

The one place where immediate change might be necessary is that if there are
any narrow-contract functions targeted for C++26 that are currently annotated
with `noexcept`, we probably want to change those annotations to
`[[throws_nothing]]` or say nothing at all and leave it up to the
implementation whether to use `[[throws_nothing]]`.  Violations of the Lakos
Rule already in C++23 could be handled on a case-by-case basis (via
DR). Minimizing such violations would result in greater stability across
implementations and versions of the Standard.


Implementation Experience
=========================

At present, no compilers implement this feature. If this paper receives a
favorable response in EWGI, we will implement it before presenting
it to EWG. Implementation is expected to be a fairly simple delta on the
existing implementation of `noexcept`.


Formal wording
==============

TBD: Wording will be provided after EWGI shows initial interest, i.e., after a
positive result in an "encourages more work" poll.
