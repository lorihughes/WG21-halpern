Abstract
========

When the polymorphic allocator infrastructure was moved from the Library
Fundamentals TS to the C++17 working draft, `pmr::resource_adaptor` was left
behind. The decision not to move `pmr::resource_adaptor` was deliberately
conservative, but the absence of `resource_adaptor` in the standard is a
hole that must be plugged for a smooth transition to the ubiquitous use of
`polymorphic_allocator`, as proposed in [P0339](http://wg21.link/p0339) and
[P0987](http://wg21.link/p0987).  This paper proposes that
`pmr::resource_adaptor` be moved from the LFTS and added to the C++20 working
draft.

History
=======

Changes from R1 to R2 (in San Diego)
------------------------------------

 * Paper was forwarded from LEWG to LWG on Tuesday, 2018-10-06
 * Copied the formal wording from the LFTS directly into this paper
 * Minor wording changes as per initial LWG review
 * Rebased to the October 2018 draft of the C++ WP

Changes from R0 to R1 (pre-San Diego)
-------------------------------------

 * Added a note for LWG to consider clarifying the alignment requirements for
   `resource_adaptor<A>::do_allocate()`.
 * Changed rebind type from `char` to `byte`.
 * Rebased to July 2018 draft of the C++ WP.

Motivation
==========

It is expected that more and more classes, especially those that would not
otherwise be templates, will use `pmr::polymorphic_allocator<byte>` to
allocate memory. In order to pass an allocator to one of these classes, the
allocator must either already be a polymorphic allocator, or must be adapted
from a non-polymorphic allocator.  The process of adaptation is facilitated by
`pmr::resource_adaptor`, which is a simple class template, has been in the
LFTS for a long time, and has been fully implemented. It is therefore a
low-risk, high-benefit component to add to the C++ WP.

Impact on the standard
======================

`pmr::resource_adaptor` is a pure library extension requiring no changes to
the core language nor to any existing classes in the standard library.

Formal Wording
==============

_This proposal is based on the Library Fundamentals TS v2,
[N4617](http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2016/n4617.pdf) and
the October 2018 draft of the C++ WP,
[N4778](http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2018/n4778.pdf)._

_In section 19.12.1 [mem.res.syn] of the C++ WP, add the following declaration
immediately after the declaration of
`operator!=(const polymorphic_allocator...)`:_

    // 19.12.x resource adaptor
    // The name resource_adaptor_imp is for exposition only.
    template <class Allocator> class resource_adaptor_imp;

    template <class Allocator>
      using resource_adaptor = resource_adaptor_imp<
        typename allocator_traits<Allocator>::template rebind_alloc<byte>>;

_Insert between sections 19.12.3 [mem.poly.allocator.class] and 19.12.4
[mem.res.global] of the C++ WP, the following section, taken from section 8.7
of the LFTS v2:_

**19.12.x template alias resource_adaptor [memory.resource.adaptor]**

**19.12.x.1 resource_adaptor [memory.resource.adaptor.overview]**

An instance of `resource_adaptor<Allocator>` is an adaptor that wraps a
`memory_resource` interface around `Allocator`.  To ensure that
`resource_adaptor<X<T>>` and `resource_adaptor<X<U>>` are the same type for
any allocator template `X` and types `T` and `U`,
`resource_adaptor<Allocator>` is rendered as an alias to a class template such
that Allocator is rebound to a `byte` value type in every specialization of
the class template. The requirements on this class template are defined
below. The name _resource_adaptor_imp_ is for exposition only and is not
normative, but the definitions of the members of that class, whatever its
name, _are_ normative. In addition to the _Cpp17Allocator_ requirements
(ยง15.5.3.5), the `Allocator` parameter to `resource_adaptor` shall meet the
following additional requirements:

 - `typename allocator_traits<Allocator>::pointer` shall be identical to  
   `typename allocator_traits<Allocator>::value_type*`.

 - `typename allocator_traits<Allocator>::const_pointer` shall be identical
    to `typename allocator_traits<Allocator>::value_type const*`.

 - `typename allocator_traits<Allocator>::void_pointer` shall be identical to
   `void*`.

 - `typename allocator_traits<Allocator>::const_void_pointer` shall be
   identical to `void const*`.

```
// The name resource_adaptor_imp is for exposition only.
template <class Allocator>
class resource_adaptor_imp : public memory_resource {
  Allocator m_alloc; // for exposition only

public:
  using allocator_type = Allocator;

  resource_adaptor_imp() = default;
  resource_adaptor_imp(const resource_adaptor_imp&) = default;
  resource_adaptor_imp(resource_adaptor_imp&&) = default;

  explicit resource_adaptor_imp(const Allocator& a2);
  explicit resource_adaptor_imp(Allocator&& a2);

  resource_adaptor_imp& operator=(const resource_adaptor_imp&) = default;

  allocator_type get_allocator() const { return m_alloc; }

protected:
  void* do_allocate(size_t bytes, size_t alignment) override;
  void do_deallocate(void* p, size_t bytes, size_t alignment) override;
  bool do_is_equal(const memory_resource& other) const noexcept override;
};
```

**19.12.x.2 resource_adaptor_imp constructors [memory.resource.adaptor.ctor]**

`explicit resource_adaptor_imp(const Allocator& a2);`

> _Effects_: Initializes `m_alloc` with `a2`.

`explicit resource_adaptor_imp(Allocator&& a2);`

> _Effects_: Initializes `m_alloc` with `std::move(a2)`.

**19.12.x.3 resource_adaptor_imp member functions [memory.resource.adaptor.mem]**

`void* do_allocate(size_t bytes, size_t alignment);`

> _Expects:_ `alignment` shall be a power of two.

> _Returns:_ a pointer to allocated storage obtained by calling the `allocate`
> member function on a suitably rebound copy of `m_alloc` such that the
> expected size and alignment of the allocated memory are at least `bytes` and
> `alignment`, respectively. If the rebound `Allocator` supports over-aligned
> storage, then `resource_adaptor<Allocator>` should also support over-aligned
> storage.

> _Throws:_ nothing unless the underlying allocator throws.

`void do_deallocate(void* p, size_t bytes, size_t alignment);`

> _Expects_: `p` shall have been returned from a prior call to `allocate(bytes,
> alignment)` on a memory resource equal to `*this`, and the storage at `p` shall not
> yet have been deallocated.

> _Effects_: Returns memory to the allocator using `m_alloc.deallocate`.

`bool do_is_equal(const memory_resource& other) const noexcept;`

> Let `p` be `dynamic_cast<const resource_adaptor_imp*>(&other)`.

> _Returns_: false if `p` is null; otherwise the value of `m_alloc == p->m_alloc`.
